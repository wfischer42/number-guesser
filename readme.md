# Number Guesser
This is my first Javascript App. It's a game. Spoiler: the trick is to guess a number. With each guess, the game will tell you if your guess was too high or too low, and then you guess again. There's not a lot of replay value, unless your still learning to count, but I'm not trying to win any awards with this one. Just learning some Javascript. Enjoy!
