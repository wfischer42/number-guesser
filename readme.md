# Number Guesser
This is my first Javascript App. It's a game. Spoiler: the trick is to guess a number. With each guess, the game will tell you if your guess was too high or too low, and then you guess again. There's not a lot of replay value, unless you're still learning to count. But it's not like I'm trying to win awards with this one - just learning some Javascript. Enjoy!
